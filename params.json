{"name":"BST","tagline":"A Bootstrap 3 Starter Theme, for WordPress","body":"**BST is a (very) simple WordPress starter theme loaded with Bootstrap 3.**\r\n\r\n*Version 1.5*\r\n\r\n\r\n##Features\r\n\r\n* *Simple, intuitive, clean code.*\r\n* CSS, JS, functions and template parts in different folders.\r\n* **Bootstrap 3.2.0** - CSS and JS enqueued. You can simply swap the default Bootstrap 3 files (included) for a custom made Bootstrap 3, and this theme will still work.\r\n* **jQuery 1.11.1** called from Google CDN, with a local fallback when offline.\r\n* **NEW: WooCommerce** plugin support.\r\n* **NEW:** Choice of two navbar positions (top of screen and/or below site title). Simply delete what you don't need.\r\n* A starter CSS theme - `bst.css`, enqueued.\r\n* Visual editor stylesheet - into which the same Bootsrap 3 and starter CSS theme are preloaded by `@import`, so that **WYSI(M!)WYG** - what you see in the visual editor is (mostly!) what you get at the front end.\r\n* `Modernizr.js`, `respond.js` and `html5shiv.css` included - enqueued.\r\n* Clean-up scripts in place - for helping web design newbies find their way around the HTML outputted by WordPress. (Do not rely on these for security.)\r\n* A few simple jQuery scripts - in `bst.js`, enqueued. Example: **Hovernav** (see below).\r\n* Custom comment list callback.\r\n* Easily make this theme your own - if you rename `bst.css` to `yourtheme.css`, and `bst.js` to `yourtheme.js`, and then do a global search-and-replace to rename \"bst\" to \"yourtheme\" everywhere in the theme's code, this theme will still work. (You must also modify the comments in `style.css`, and rename the root folder from **bst/** to **yourtheme/**.)\r\n* [MIT licence](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) (open source).\r\n\r\nThis theme has been built for use as a starter theme and as a learning aid for people who wish to get into WordPress theme design.\r\n\r\n###Hovernav\r\n\r\nThe navbar has some modifications that make the dropdown menu appear on hover (in `bst.js` plus `bst.css`). *The Bootstrap js and css have not been changed*. You can easily delete the \"hovernav\" segments of bst.js and bst.css if you don't want them. \r\n\r\n##Notes on WooCommerce support\r\n\r\n* You will need to install the WooCommerce plugin - http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/\r\n* I have included the *minimum* additions to BST to make WooCommerce work (this is a starter theme). It will work fine with these minimum additions, but you can add more style and improve the layout.\r\n* WooCommerce uses WooCommerce-styled buttons, icons, etc. in its shop, cart, checkout etc. - these are not the same as the Bootstrap buttons, icons etc. I have not replaced the WooCommerce buttons with Bootstrap buttons, because that would mean that you have no control over the appearance of these buttons from within the WooCommerce plugin settings.\r\n* However I have applied Bootstrap styling to the cart and checkout forms, using jQuery insertion of Bootstrap CSS classes.\r\n* You will need to add a \"Shop\" link, e.g. to your primary menu\r\n* You will need to add some WooCommerce Widgets to the sidebar (at minimum, WooCommerce Cart and WooCommerce Categories)\r\n* And, of course, you will need to add salable items to your shop, and set up your payment gateway.\r\n\r\nFind out more about WooCommerce here: http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/\r\n\r\n###What if you don't want WooCommerce support in BST?\r\n\r\nSimply delete or remove these things that you won't be needing:\r\n\r\n* **Remove:** woocommerce.php .\r\n* **Remove:** /func/woocommerce-setup.php .\r\n* **Delete:** in /func/setup.php, scroll to the bottom and delete the line\r\n`add_theme_support('woocommerce');`\r\n* **Delete:** in /css/bst.css, scroll to the bottom and delete all the `.woocommerce` styles.\r\n* **Delete:** in /js/bst.css, scroll to the bottom and delete all that has to do with WooCommerce.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
