          <p><strong>BST is a (very) simple WordPress starter theme loaded with Bootstrap 3.</strong></p>

<p><em>Version 1.5</em></p>

<h2>
<a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h2>

<ul>
<li><em>Simple, intuitive, clean code.</em></li>
<li>CSS, JS, functions and template parts in different folders.</li>
<li>
<strong>Bootstrap 3.2.0</strong> - CSS and JS enqueued. You can simply swap the default Bootstrap 3 files (included) for a custom made Bootstrap 3, and this theme will still work.</li>
<li>
<strong>jQuery 1.11.1</strong> called from Google CDN, with a local fallback when offline.</li>
<li>
<strong>NEW: WooCommerce</strong> plugin support.</li>
<li>
<strong>NEW:</strong> Choice of two navbar positions (top of screen and/or below site title). Simply delete what you don't need.</li>
<li>A starter CSS theme - <code>bst.css</code>, enqueued.</li>
<li>Visual editor stylesheet - into which the same Bootsrap 3 and starter CSS theme are preloaded by <code>@import</code>, so that <strong>WYSI(M!)WYG</strong> - what you see in the visual editor is (mostly!) what you get at the front end.</li>
<li>
<code>Modernizr.js</code>, <code>respond.js</code> and <code>html5shiv.css</code> included - enqueued.</li>
<li>Clean-up scripts in place - for helping web design newbies find their way around the HTML outputted by WordPress. (Do not rely on these for security.)</li>
<li>A few simple jQuery scripts - in <code>bst.js</code>, enqueued. Example: <strong>Hovernav</strong> (see below).</li>
<li>Custom comment list callback.</li>
<li>Easily make this theme your own - if you rename <code>bst.css</code> to <code>yourtheme.css</code>, and <code>bst.js</code> to <code>yourtheme.js</code>, and then do a global search-and-replace to rename "bst" to "yourtheme" everywhere in the theme's code, this theme will still work. (You must also modify the comments in <code>style.css</code>, and rename the root folder from <strong>bst/</strong> to <strong>yourtheme/</strong>.)</li>
<li>
<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT licence</a> (open source).</li>
</ul><p>This theme has been built for use as a starter theme and as a learning aid for people who wish to get into WordPress theme design.</p>

<h3>
<a name="hovernav" class="anchor" href="#hovernav"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Hovernav</h3>

<p>The navbar has some modifications that make the dropdown menu appear on hover (in <code>bst.js</code> plus <code>bst.css</code>). <em>The Bootstrap js and css have not been changed</em>. You can easily delete the "hovernav" segments of bst.js and bst.css if you don't want them. </p>

<h2>
<a name="notes-on-woocommerce-support" class="anchor" href="#notes-on-woocommerce-support"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Notes on WooCommerce support</h2>

<ul>
<li>You will need to install the WooCommerce plugin - <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/">http://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/</a>
</li>
<li>I have included the <em>minimum</em> additions to BST to make WooCommerce work (this is a starter theme). It will work fine with these minimum additions, but you can add more style and improve the layout.</li>
<li>WooCommerce uses WooCommerce-styled buttons, icons, etc. in its shop, cart, checkout etc. - these are not the same as the Bootstrap buttons, icons etc. I have not replaced the WooCommerce buttons with Bootstrap buttons, because that would mean that you have no control over the appearance of these buttons from within the WooCommerce plugin settings.</li>
<li>However I have applied Bootstrap styling to the cart and checkout forms, using jQuery insertion of Bootstrap CSS classes.</li>
<li>You will need to add a "Shop" link, e.g. to your primary menu</li>
<li>You will need to add some WooCommerce Widgets to the sidebar (at minimum, WooCommerce Cart and WooCommerce Categories)</li>
<li>And, of course, you will need to add salable items to your shop, and set up your payment gateway.</li>
